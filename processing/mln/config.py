# configuration script for the MLN query & parameter learning tools
# 
#   If you want to use PyMLNs with the Alchemy System (http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu),
#   set the path where it is installed on your system in the alchemy_versions dictionary below.
#
#   Depending on your naming convention for mln and database files, you may need to change
#      query_db_filemask, query_mln_filemask, learnwts_mln_filemask and learnwts_db_filemask
#   to suit your needs.
# 
#   You can use os.getenv("VARIABLE") to retrieve the value of an environment variable
